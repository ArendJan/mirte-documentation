Build instructions
##################

.. warning::

   Currently the build instractions are still limited. We
   are working on a newer version of the hardware and want
   to add cleaner instructions as soon as we have that.


The frame is built using 1mm aluminium and 3D printed parts.
Building instructions:
- [Base](../_static/Assembly_BASE.pdf)
- [Top and arm](../_static/Assembly_TOP_ARM.pdf)


WIP: need to add more instructions, also for the cabling.

Frame build instructions: [Base instructions](../_static/Assembly_BASE.pdf)

Frame top and arm instructions: [Top instructions](../_static/Assembly_TOP_ARM.pdf)

Electronics instructions: [Electronics instructions](../_static/Assembly_electro.pdf)

Electronics and frame assembly needs to be done in sync, otherwise it's too difficult to attach the cables once everything is mounted.
