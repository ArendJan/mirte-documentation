Get Mirte Hardware
##################

One of the goals of Mirte is to be modular and extendable. Therefore Mirte has a minimal amount
of custom designed components, and mostly uses frequently used hardware. Two exceptions are
the base (which can be lasercut, 3D printed, or any existing base you already have) and the PCB
(which is optional and can be replaced by a breadboard as well). 

Below you will find the components that are used in the Mirte Basic kit, which gives you a basic
mobile platform, which can be extended with optional sensors and actuators. Or you could use
alternatives/upgrades for certain parts.

Currently it is only possible to order all the parts yourself. In the future we will make it easier
to buy a full Mirte Basic Box with all the listed components.
