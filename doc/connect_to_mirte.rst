Connect to Mirte
################

Currently there are four ways to connect to your Mirte robot. The availability depends on the SBC you use. 



Wireless
========

After booting up Mirte for the first time the robot is in acces point (AP) mode and a wifi network will be available with ssid Mirte_XXXXXX. You can connect to this network with the password mirte_mirte. While in AP mode, the ip address of Mirte is 192.168.42.1, but you could also access it with mirte.local or mirte_XXXXXX.local. In this tutorial we will always use mirte.local. 

Ethernet Wired
==============




USB connection (Windows only)
=============================





Connecting Mirte to your own Wifi
=================================

You can connect Mirte to your local wifi network from the web interface.
.. note::
Even after you connected to your own network, Mirte will start an Acces Point in case it is not able to conect to it (e.g. when somewhere else).

.. warning::
   For Windows users only: Windows 10 does not fully support mDSN. Therefore, when connecting to your own Wifi the mirte.local will not be resolved. O
