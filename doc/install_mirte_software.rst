Install Mirte Software
######################

For Mirte to work we need to install software on both the SD 
card and the microcontroller. This part only covers the 
installation of the SD card software.

.. note::

   The current link to the downloads contains a folder with 
   multiple versions of the Mirte software. At a later stage this
   will be replaced by versions created by github. For now: please
   use the latest version, unless stated otherwise).
