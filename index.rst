Zoef is yet another robot developed for education. Since the multidisiplinary aspect of robotics makes it such a good way to teach about STEM eduction, a lot of robotics kids have been developed already. So why yet another? We believe that robotic kits for education should be cheap, open source, not only focus on the software, have as few custom parts as possible, and should be useful from primary/elementary school all the way to university.

| Software    | from Blockly to Python to ROS                                        |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Electrical  | from custom PCB with STM32, to breadboard with STM32/Arduino/ESP8266 |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mechanical  | from wooden frame to own made (3D printed) frames                    |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Interaction | from cute to purely functional                                       |

So, although the robot itself is complex, we are just trying to abstract all this complexity away for the kids. The learning experience for the kids will be pealing off these abstraction layers and diving deaper and deaper into the working of the robot. This is why we thing it should be open source and have as few custom parts as possible.

Our (utopion?) goal is for each kid to get a Zoef in primary/elementary school and explore this robot throughout their educational journey. Kids should never run into a huge knowlegde gap to get to their goal. They should be limited by their knowldge, and not by the platform. With most other platforms at some point you will bump into the limitations (or customly designed parts) of the robot.

We also see that a lot of the available robotic kids focus on software. And although a lot of systems thinking can already be learned while developing the logic for your robot, there is more to it. Some problems can be solfved in both software and hardware. Some possible solutions will make you rethink your choises made in other disciplines. This should be reflected in the robot and the accompanying tutorials.

To our knowledge, such a robot does not exist yet. This is why we think we should put our time and effort into this project. But we do think there should be links to other platforms like LEGO Mindstorms and Duckybotsas well.

.. note::

   This documentation is not for the kids, but is focussing on makers, hackers, hobbyists, professionals. The Zoef tutorials for kids can be found in another repository (and to some age should not be in English only).

.. note::
   A note on the current status: Athough the basis is getting more and more useful, we are still away from being fully accessible for the full range of ages. It makes sense that the robot's core (the complex part) is the most developed. We do think we are at a stage now where it could already be used in universities (research or applied). That is why this roject is already online, but not at 1.0.
