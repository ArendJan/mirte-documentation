Mirte is yet another robot developed for education. Since the multidisiplinary aspect of robotics makes it such a good way to teach about STEM eduction, a lot of robotics kids have been developed already. So why yet another? We believe that robotic kits for education should be cheap, open source, not only focus on the software, have as few custom parts as possible, and should be useful from primary/elementary school all the way to university.
